# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Repository Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: _Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones_

* The code downloads the compressed file (.zip) and extract the files into a directory. If the directory doesnot exist, the codes created the directory as well.

* The file CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data and generate the final file.

* run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. This scrip can be executed in RStudio

* The output of the 5th step in the r code is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's repository.
